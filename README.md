# MERN Stack & OpenAI Image Generation Project

# Visit at - [Click here](https://image-generating-ai.netlify.app)

### This is a web application project that uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate images based on user preferences.

## Project Overview

### The goal of this project is to provide users with a tool to generate images based on their input. Users can enter a description or keyword of the image they want to generate, and the OpenAI GPT-3 model will generate an image that matches the user's input.

### The web application has a front-end built with React and a back-end built with Node.js and Express. The user interface allows users to input their preferences and submit a request for the image generation. The back-end server then communicates with the OpenAI API to generate the image, and the result is displayed to the user.

## Prerequisites

### Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

## 1 Node.js
## 2 MongoDB
## 3 OpenAI API Key
## 4 Installation

## Clone the repository to your local machine.
### Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies for the server using npm install.
### Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies for the client using npm install.
### Create a .env file in the root of the project directory and add the following environment variables:
### makefile

```console 
PORT=<port number>
MONGODB_URI=<mongo db uri>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai api key>
Run the development server using npm run dev.
Usage
```

## To use the web application, navigate to http://localhost:<port number> in your web browser.

### On the home page, enter a description or keyword of the image you want to generate in the input field and click on the "Generate Image" button. The OpenAI GPT-3 model will generate an image based on your input and display it on the screen.

### You can also view a list of previously generated images by clicking on the "View Gallery" button.
